	<h2>Welcome</h2>
	<p>This page was created in the scope of a bachelor thesis. The main goal was the automated creation of causal graphs. The user of these page can put it a number of differnce test and get then a nice causal graph. </p>
	<h3>Causal theory</h3>
	<p>All the algorithms which are implemented base on the causal theory of Michael Baumgartner and Gerd Gra√ühoff. The approach of this theory is based on the INUS-conditions of J. L. Mackie. (more) </p>
	<h3>Who can use this page</h3>
	<p>This page is created to show you the benefits of the causal theory of the University of Berne. So if you want to isolate a causal graph for your experiment, then use this page.</p>
	<h3>How can I use this page</h3>
	<p>The usage of these page is simple, but it can be difficult to understood the causal theory. We will add a simple tutorial soon and you can find texts about the theory.</p>
