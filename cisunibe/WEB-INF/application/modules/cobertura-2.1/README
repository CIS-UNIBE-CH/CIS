* Cobertura plugin for the Play framework *
*******************************************

*********
* ABOUT *
*********
This module for the Play! framework provides a plugin to support the Cobertura
test coverage tool. 

Cobertura is a free Java tool that calculates the percentage of code accessed by
tests. It can be used to identify which parts of your Java program are lacking
test coverage. It is based on jcoverage.

See http://cobertura.sourceforge.net/ for more information.


*********
* USING *
*********
To activate it, simply add the following line to your project's
conf/application.conf file:
	module.cobertura=${play.path}/modules/cobertura

This plugin is intended for use in the 'test' mode, and will silently do nothing
in other modes. Therefore, you can leave it activated while running your
application in other modes.

Then, run your tests as normal, for example:
	play test

Once the test run is finished, stop the Play! framework and an HTML report will
be generated automatically in a directory named "test-coverage-report" in your
project. You can view this in your web browser.

Note: in some cases, you may need to run "play clean" first, in particular if
you get coverage reports of 0% everywhere!


************
* BUILDING *
************
The Cobertura plugin should be built as part of the Play! framework build
process. An ant buildfile is provided for this purpose.

The current source code of Cobertura needs one minor patch to be used by this
plugin. See the following link for detail on the request to integrate this in
the core of Cobertura:
https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2831576&group_id=130558&atid=720017

Running ant on the provided buildfile will perform these steps:
1) Attempt to download source code to Cobertura 1.9.2.
2) Attempt to patch this source code.
3) Attempt to build the patched source code into a JAR.
4) Copy this JAR to the plugin's lib/ directory.
5) Build this plugin into a JAR.

* DOCUMENTATION *
*****************
This is currently all documentation available on this plugin.

Insight into the inner workings can be obtained by reading the JavaDoc comments
in the code, available as HTML by running:
	ant javadoc


*************
* LICENSING *
*************
Cobertura and this plugin are licensed under the GPLv2. See the 'COPYING' file
in this directory for details.

The Play! framework is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license, and provides an
interface to develop plugins independently from the core of the framework. It is
therefore my understanding that this situation is in full respect of the GPLv2.
